step 1 imports
step 2 inspect vairable types
step 3 data exploration, - Displaying first 5 rows
 - Checking dataset shape (rows, columns)
 - Examining a specific row
 - Analyzing species distribution
 - Computing mean of numerical variables
 step 4: Generate and Save Variable Summaries
 step 5 Create Histograms for Each Variable
These histograms show the distribution of each variable in the dataset.
step 6 : Scatter Plots of Variable Pairs by Species
 These scatter plots visualize relationships between different numerical variables, categorized by species.
Step 7: Correlation Analysis & Heatmap
The correlation matrix shows the relationships between numerical variables.
